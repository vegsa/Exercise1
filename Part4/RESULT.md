This code creates two threads where one of them increments the variable "i" and the other decrements the variable "i", where they use the same i. First, the two threads is created and then the two threads alters between incrementing and decrementing the variable "i". Thus the variable will get a value between -1 000 000 and 1 000 000 dependent on which of the threads who gets to "use" i the most. Hence, i will be (most probably) a different value when we run the program the next time.
